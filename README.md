I am a recent computer science major who has been struggling with self-study. I heavily rely on large language models, and with their help, I have learned a lot and made rapid progress.

I have found that large language models (such as ChatGPT-4o and others) are incredibly helpful to human learners due to their strong prior knowledge and RAG technology, as well as their increasingly powerful reasoning and analogical abilities.

This repository will be used to store my discoveries and insights (currently focused on human self-study in the field of computer science, but can be expanded to other areas in the future), and I would love to welcome and look forward to other like-minded friends who share their experiences of learning with large models.
